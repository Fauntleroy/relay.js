# relay.js

### Kinder, Simpler IRC.

Relay.js is a web-based IRC client that focuses on making IRC less intimidating and easier to use.


### Demo: [www.relayjs.com](http://www.relayjs.com?server=irc.freenode.net&channels=relay.js)

* *This is only a demonstration server. It may break, crash, or stall at any time without warning. It's highly recommended that you host your own instance of Relay.js for prolonged use.*

- Rearrangeable, modular interface
- Interface elements for certain IRC commands, such as banning/kicking a user
- Tab completion for usernames, emoticons, certain commands

## Installation

- Install the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- Pull this repository
- Run `npm install` in the base directory
- Compile assets with `grunt build` command
- Run `node relay.js` or `grunt dev`
- Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

If you plan on doing development, you'll want to install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Running `grunt dev` (or `npm run dev` if you don't have/want Grunt globally installed) will build the assets (unminified), start the server, and watch + recompile the assets on change. A full list of grunt tasks can be seen with `grunt -h`.

## Configuration

Relay.js supports simple server configuration via `config.js` and URL parameters. The `config.js` file must simply export a javascript object with the desired properties filled in. Current configuration options are as follows:

* **defaults** *object* - A set of default options to use on initial load. Includes **server** and **channels**.
* **defaults.server** *object* - An object specifying a preset server to connect to. If **locked** is set to `true`, these settings cannot be overridden, and by default the user is limited to a single connection. Parameters are **host**, **port**, **ssl**, and **password**.
* **defaults.nick** *string* - A nick that auto populates the 'Nick' input in the connect dialog.
* **defaults.channels** *array* - An array of channels that populate the 'Channels' input on the connect dialog.
* **max_connections** *integer* - The maximum number of connections that can be made from a single client. When `defaults.server.locked` is set, this will default to **1**.

To set these options, just make a `config.js` in the main directory of the app. Here's a quick example:

```js
module.exports = {
	"defaults": {
		"server": {
			"host": "irc.freenode.net"
		},
		"channels": [
			"#relay.js"
		]
	},
	"max_connections": 3
}
```

Some defaults may also be set using URL parameters. Defaults specified in the URL will override those in `config.js`, except for locked parameters. The following parameters are available:

* **server** - The URL of an IRC server (ex: "irc.freenode.net"). Maps to **defaults.server.host**.
* **port** - The port of an IRC server (ex: 9001). Maps to **defaults.server.port**.
* **ssl** - Connect with SSL (ex: true). Maps to **defaults.server.ssl**.
* **nick** - The default nick to connect with (ex: "Fauntleroy"). Maps to **defaults.nick**.
* **channels** - A comma separated list of channels to join (ex: "relay.js,tksync"). Maps to **defaults.channels**.
