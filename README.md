## Installation

- Install the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- Pull this repository
- Run `npm install` in the base directory
- Run `node relay.js`
- Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Configuration

Relay.js supports simple server configuration via `config.json`. As time goes on, more configuration options will be added. Presently, the following two parameters are supported:

* **max_connections** *integer* - The maximum number of connections that can be made from a single client.
* **preset_server** *object* - An object specifying a preset server to connect to. This limits the user to a single connection to just this server. Parameters are **host**, **port**, and **password**.
* **suggested_channels** *array* - An array of channels that populate the 'Channels' input on the connect dialog.

To set these options, just make a `config.json` in the main directory of the app. Here's a quick example:

```json
{
	"preset_server": {
		"host": "irc.freenode.net"
	},
	"suggested_channels": [
		"#relay.js"
	]
}
```
